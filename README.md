# React E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the React E-Commerce Website project! This project is a front-end implementation of an e-commerce website using React, CSS, and various other technologies to create a seamless and dynamic shopping experience. Below, you'll find information about the technologies used, project structure, and how to get started.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The core library for building the user interface, providing a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability.

- **CSS:** Styling is implemented using CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive design for the e-commerce website.

- **Context API:** The Context API is used for state management, allowing efficient and centralized data sharing among components without the need for prop drilling.

- **Props:** React props are utilized to pass data between components, enabling the transfer of information and functionality down the component tree.

- **States:** React states are employed to manage component-specific data and handle dynamic changes in the application's state.

- **React Router DOM:** Used for navigation within the application, React Router DOM enables the creation of a single-page application with multiple views.

- **JavaScript:** Additional JavaScript functionalities are implemented to enhance the interactivity and dynamic behavior of the website.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into various components, each serving a specific purpose to create a modular and maintainable codebase. The key directories include:

- **src/components:** Contains individual React components, each responsible for specific UI elements or features.

- **src/context:** Holds context providers and consumers, utilizing the Context API for state management.

- **src/styles:** Houses CSS files for styling, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

- **src/utils:** Includes utility functions and helper scripts to enhance the functionality of the application.
